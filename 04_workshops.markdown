## 1st Experimental Sociology Workshop (24-25 June 2021)

The growing interest in causal explanations and social mechanisms through well-constructed sociological theories has motivated many researchers to turn to experimental research design
to advance empirical knowledge. This workshop will provide a platform for researchers to discuss their new experimental research in sociology. We especially encourage contributions
from early career researchers. There will be a dedicated discussant from our program committee for each extended abstract, as well as open floor discussion. Extended abstracts
(1250 words max.) are invited on a wide range of research topics in sociology, using field, laboratory, natural, and survey experiments.

The workshop hosts a keynote speech delivered by Delia Baldassarri (New York University). There is no participation fee. To submit your extended abstract – especially the studies that are yet to be pre-registered are welcome–, please send an email to Burak Sonmez at [b.sonmez@lse.ac.uk](mailto:b.sonmez@ucl.ac.uk). In the subject header please add “Submission: Workshop on
Experimental Sociology”. In the case of multiple-authored papers, indicate who will present. The authors will be notified about the outcome of their submission in late May. The detailed
schedule of the workshop will be announced in early June.
