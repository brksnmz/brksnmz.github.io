### Hi,

I am a Lecturer in [the Centre for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/centres/quantitative-social-science){:target="_blank"}, UCL Social Research Institute at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

My broad research interests centre around social norms, trust, collective action, beliefs, other-regarding preferences, and social stratification. My studies primarily use experimental methods and computational tools. 

Prior to joining UCL, I was an LSE Fellow in Quantitative Social Research Methods in the Department of Sociology at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology){:target="_blank"}. 

I received my Ph.D. in Sociology at [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology){:target="_blank"}. I hold a Master’s degree in Longitudinal Social Research from the same institution and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Bilkent University](http://econ.bilkent.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:b.sonmez@ucl.ac.uk) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/socioburak){:target="_blank"}.
