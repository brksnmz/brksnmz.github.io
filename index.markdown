Hi,

I am a Lecturer in Quantitative Social Science and currently the Programme Director of BSc in Social Sciences with Data Science at UCL Social Research Institute, [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a founding member & co-organiser of [Experimental Sociology Workshop](https://experimentalsociology.github.io/){:target="_blank"} 

My broad research interests centre around social norms; trust; collective actions; beliefs; and inequality. My studies primarily use experimental methods and computational tools. 

My work has been published or is forthcoming in the European Sociological Review, the Journal of Peace Research, PLOS ONE, Social Psychology Quarterly, and Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World. 

Prior to joining UCL, I was an LSE Fellow in Quantitative Social Research Methods at the Department of Sociology, [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D. in Sociology at [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology){:target="_blank"}. I hold a Master’s degree in Longitudinal Social Research from the same institution and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Bilkent University](http://econ.bilkent.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"}. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:b.sonmez@ucl.ac.uk) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/socioburak){:target="_blank"}.
