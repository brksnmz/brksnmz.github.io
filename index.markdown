Hi,

I am an Associate Professor in Quantitative Social Science at UCL Social Research Institute, [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

Prior to joining UCL, I was an LSE Fellow in Quantitative Social Research Methods at the Department of Sociology, [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D. in Sociology at [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sociology){:target="_blank"}. I hold a Master’s degree in Longitudinal Social Research from the same institution and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Bilkent University](http://econ.bilkent.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research focuses on the micro-level mechanisms driving complex social phenomena and their macro-level outcomes, including social norms, collective action, trust, punishment, beliefs, and inequality. I primarily use experimental methods and computational tools to investigate these processes. 

My work has been supported by grants from the British Academy, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation, and the Education Endowment Foundation and published in Nature Scientific Reports, the European Sociological Review, the Journal of Peace Research, Social Psychology Quarterly among others. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:b.sonmez@ucl.ac.uk) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/buraksonmez.bsky.social){:target="_blank"}.
